I utilized the Youtube API from Google and Material UI to create a video player user interface that mimics Youtube. It comes equipped with a list of videos on the side and a search bar where you can search any Youtube video. Whenever a user searchs a topic, a placeholder video is rendered along with a list of videos relevant to the search topic.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
